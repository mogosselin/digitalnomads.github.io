### Introduction
There was a need for storing essential informations for [#nomads 
community](http://hashtagnomads.com). An obvious way of doing that would be by using a 
wiki, but all the wiki engines out there are pretty complicated. So this 
idea of using github and middleman was born.

- This is completely open source project hosted by Github pages
- Powered by Middleman static site generator
- Editing through github with pretty simple yaml files
- Website could be built and published automatically by CircleCi or any other CI that ofer free packages for open source (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Comments by disqus (comments per entry are not implemented, but is first priority)

### Requirements
- Ruby
- Git

### Running project locally
- bundle install
- middleman 
- go to [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)

### Goal
The goal is not to gather all posibile products aimed/suitable for digital 
nomads, but to offer information that can help to provide possibile answers and 
help make educated decisions.
